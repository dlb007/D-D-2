       "      <td>The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of the city symphony, a film phenomenon\\n                              of experimental-documentary city films that took the modern metropolis\\n                              as their protagonist and presented it in its multiple facets and\\n                              kaleidoscopic nature. While Ruttmannâs Berlin. Die Sinfonie der\\n                                    Grosstadt (1927) and Vertovâs Chelovek s kinoapparatom (1929) gained canonical status\\n                              and exert a considerable influence on filmmaking to this very day, the\\n                              city symphony has remained a somewhat downplayed and neglected\\n                              phenomenon in film history. Indeed, besides the handful of well-known\\n                              titles, there have been more than eighty films made around the globe,\\n                              many of which fell into oblivion and have received little or no\\n                              scholarly attention at all. Moreover, even the canonical examples have\\n                              never systematically and structurally been analyzed in detail in a\\n                              comparative way. The result is the lack of a sophisticated and clear\\n                              definition of the city symphony, based on both the canonical films and\\n                              the greater city symphony corpus. My research sets in at this point,\\n                              addressing the conspicuous absence of an analysis of city symphony\\n                              characteristics. It does so by making use of a combined methodology of\\n                              traditional film analysis methods and digital tools. This article\\n                              reflects on the methodology applied and tools chosen and put into\\n                              practice to study and analyze the visual material of city symphonies,\\n                              which with their highly complex structure, dense imagery, and themes\\n                              as well as their experimental techniques and striking editing\\n                              patterns, are a perfect fit for a computational film analysis.\\n                              Particularly, the digital film/video annotation software ELAN, the\\n                              Cinemetrics method, a bar chart representation of shot lengths, and\\n                              the grid visualizations of multiple film frames created with ImageJ\\n                              play a role in this case study, which also broaches the aspect and\\n                              benefits of manual digital analysis.</td>\n",

However, software solutions for the scholarly study of film that\\n               utilise video analysis algorithms are still relatively rare. In this paper, we aim to\\n               provide an overview of related work in this field, review current developments in\\n               computer vision, compare machine and human performance for some visual recognition\\n               tasks, and outline the requirements for video analysis software that would optimally\\n               support scholars of film studies.  \n",

Working with transcribed dialogue in almost 300\\n               productions, we explore the complex way in which most-frequent-words-based stylometry\\n               and lexicon-based sentiment analysis produce patterns of similarity and difference\\n               between screenwriters and/or a priori IMDB-defined genres. In fact, some of our\\n               results show that counting and comparing very frequent word lists reveals further\\n               similarities: of theme, implied audience, stylistic patternings. The results are\\n               encouraging enough to suggest that such quantitative approach to film dialogue may\\n               become a welcome addition to the arsenal of film studies methodology.   \n",

As a result, access to digital archives is still governed overwhelmingly by\\n               a logic of search. In practice, this means that users not only need to know what they\\n               are looking for, but are also constrained by the interpretive frameworks informing\\n               the materialsâ labelling. Arguably, this poses restrictions on what they can find,\\n               how they can interrelate collection objects, and ultimately, how they can reuse or\\n               reinterpret collections. Taking such issues as its starting point, the Sensory Moving Image Archive project (SEMIA) investigated\\n               how visual analysis tools can help enable more exploratory forms of engaging with\\n               digital archives. In doing so, it focused on sensory features, which are essential to\\n               usersâ experiences of audiovisual heritage objects but inadequately captured by\\n               verbal description.  \n",
       "6  The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of the city symphony, a film phenomenon\\n                              of experimental-documentary city films that took the modern metropolis\\n                              as their protagonist and presented it in its multiple facets and\\n                              kaleidoscopic nature. While Ruttmannâs Berlin. Die Sinfonie der\\n                                    Grosstadt (1927) and Vertovâs Chelovek s kinoapparatom (1929) gained canonical status\\n                              and exert a considerable influence on filmmaking to this very day, the\\n                              city symphony has remained a somewhat downplayed and neglected\\n                              phenomenon in film history. Indeed, besides the handful of well-known\\n                              titles, there have been more than eighty films made around the globe,\\n                              many of which fell into oblivion and have received little or no\\n                              scholarly attention at all. Moreover, even the canonical examples have\\n                              never systematically and structurally been analyzed in detail in a\\n                              comparative way. The result is the lack of a sophisticated and clear\\n                              definition of the city symphony, based on both the canonical films and\\n                              the greater city symphony corpus. My research sets in at this point,\\n                              addressing the conspicuous absence of an analysis of city symphony\\n                              characteristics. It does so by making use of a combined methodology of\\n                              traditional film analysis methods and digital tools. This article\\n                              reflects on the methodology applied and tools chosen and put into\\n                              practice to study and analyze the visual material of city symphonies,\\n                              which with their highly complex structure, dense imagery, and themes\\n                              as well as their experimental techniques and striking editing\\n                              patterns, are a perfect fit for a computational film analysis.\\n                              Particularly, the digital film/video annotation software ELAN, the\\n                              Cinemetrics method, a bar chart representation of shot lengths, and\\n                              the grid visualizations of multiple film frames created with ImageJ\\n                              play a role in this case study, which also broaches the aspect and\\n                              benefits of manual digital analysis.
