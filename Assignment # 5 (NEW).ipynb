Note that the completeness and organization of the CSV will impact your success, so you might want to investigate it using our initial methods before you commit to it and your object of analysis.\r\n",

It opened up the film industry components to a data set between years and had elements of interest in categories and data results in multiple areas. Moving forward, there may be an advantage to exploring more well-known libraries. Still, this initial find was a great starting point due to the data inclusion and range of selections of popular and known subjects and titles."
